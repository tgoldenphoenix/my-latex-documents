\section{Combinations and Permutations}

When the order doesn't matter, it is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination}{Combination} (tổ hợp).

When the order does matter it is a Permutation (hoán vị). In other words, A Permutation is an ordered Combination.

To help you to remember, think "Permutation ... Position".

\subsection{Permutations without Repetition}

Without repetition our choices get reduced each time.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
  \label{eq:permutation-no-repeat}
\end{equation}

where \textbf{n} is the number of things to choose from, and we choose \(r\) of them, no repetitions, order matters.

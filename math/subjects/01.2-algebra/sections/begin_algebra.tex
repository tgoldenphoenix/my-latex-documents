% \vspace{0.2 cm}

If \(A(x_{1},y_{1})\text{ and } B(x_{2},y_{2})\) are two points on a line, \textbf{the slope of the line} is defined by the equation below.

\begin{equation}
  m = \frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
  \label{eq:3.1}
\end{equation}

\hl{Slope} (hệ số góc) measures the steepness of a line. If the slope of a line is positive, the line travels up moving from left to right. If the slope of a line is negative, the line travels down moving left to right. If the slope of a line is zero, the line is horizontal. If the slope of a line is undefined, the line is vertical.

\textbf{Slope} (hệ số góc) cho biết rate of change. Two parallel lines have \textit{the same} slope.

\textbf{Excercise}: Identify the form of each linear equation below by writing \q{S} for Standard, \q{SI} for slope-intercept, or \q{PS} for point-slope.

$2x+4y=3$: \textbf{S} because the variables x and y are on the same side of the equation.

$4=-8x+7x$: still Standard form, even though the equation is flipped.

$y-4=-3(x-5)$: \textbf{PS}, it is the only form that has parenthesses.

$y=2x+4$: \textbf{SI}, because the y is isolated on one side of the equation.

\textbf{Q:} Graph this line \(3x-4y=-6\)

Find the \textbf{x-intercept} by making y = 0. Then find the \textbf{y-intercept} by making x = 0.

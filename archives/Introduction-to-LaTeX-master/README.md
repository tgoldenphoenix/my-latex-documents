# Introduction to LaTeX

[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

This is a collection of resources used to teach LaTeX at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo.

First,
the students are given a [general introduction](latex) to LaTeX
with focus on writing mathematics, using floats and cross references.

This is followed by an [introduction to BibLaTeX](biblatex.md),
which is a package for managing citations and reference lists.

The students are provided with both an [English template](template.tex) and a [Norwegian template](mal.tex) for their first document.

After having tried writing LaTeX themselves,
the students are advised to read a note about [avoiding common mistakes](common-mistakes.md).

For longer texts,
the students are given a [guide for structuring large documents](large-documents.md)
and a [template](starting-kit) implementing the tips from the guide.

Finally,
the students are given an [introduction to Beamer](beamer),
showing them how to create slides and posters using LaTeX.

## UiO LaTeX resources

In addition to the general resources above,
there are templates and packages specific to the University of Oslo
available to the students.
These can be found under the [UiO tag at Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/uio)
and in the following GitHub repositories:
* [phduio-article-based](https://github.com/martinhelso/phduio-article-based), a template for article based PhD theses;
* [phduio-monograph](https://github.com/martinhelso/phduio-monograph), a template for monographic PhD theses;
* [uioposter](https://github.com/martinhelso/uioposter), a class for scientific posters;
* [mnfrontpage](https://github.com/martinhelso/mnfrontpage), a package for front pages for documents at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences;
* [masterfrontpage](https://github.com/martinhelso/masterfrontpage), a package for front pages for master's theses at the Department of Mathematics;
* [MathDept](https://github.com/martinhelso/MathDept), a `beamer` theme for the Department of Mathematics.

I'm Pham An Hao, a hard-working and determined professional Full-stack Developer. I Love building software to solve real-world problems for businesses and customers with a ``Product-minded'' mental model in mind.

\section{Education \& Work Experience}

\subsection{High Schooll}

\cventry{2017--2020}{Student}{\href{https://www.facebook.com/thptchuyenbentre/?locale=vi_VN}{BenTre High School for Gifted Students}}{Major in Biology}{}{}

\subsection{Higher Education}

\cventry{2020--2022}{General Medical Doctor Undergraduate}{\href{https://ctump.edu.vn/}{Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy}}{}{}{Back in high school, my only concern was to pass the exams with good grades and follow the goal set by my parents of becoming a doctor. During the COVID-19 lockdown time, I suddenly had more time at home and began to ask myself if I really want to pursue this career for the next 6-8 years. In the end, after much contemplation and consulting with my family, classmates and teachers, I decided to take my leave of absence from school at the end of the 2\textsuperscript{nd} year.}

\cventry{2022--2023}{}{}{}{}{Spent some time finding myself. This was a courageous endeavour that didn't have a title. It was quite important to my overall development though so I'm adding it to my CV. Also it explains the gap in my CV.

Detailed achievements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Learned programming on freeCodeCamp, \textsc{CS50}. I also stumbled upon the FOSS community and developed a deep appreciation for it.% Today, I use Neovim to write both my \LaTeX math notes and other notes that use the markdown syntax.
  \item Refresh my memory about Math since it was my most favourite subject in High School. I discovered \LaTeX — which I used to typeset this \textit{curriculum vitae}. I also use \LaTeX to write my math notes.
  % \newpage
  \item Started learning Japanese.% As of now, I can recognize around 2000 Kanji and be able to understand basic words and sentences in Mandarina, Cantonese, Japanese and some Vietnamese scripts of old.
  %It is worth mentioning that I do not specifically choose to learn a language such as Chinese Mandarin but rather focusing on acquainting myself with the many different characters.
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \item In the past, Chinese character (chữ Hán) along with "Chữ Nôm"\ was widely used in Vietnam both in official documents and literature. Nowadays, Chinese character is still being used in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and many other East Asia countries.
  %   \item Learning Chinese characters therefore gives me a deeper appreciation regarding the East Asian culture sphere as well as open many opportunities in the future.
